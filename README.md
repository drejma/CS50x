# CS50x 2023

[CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) is Harvard University's online introductory course into computer science and programming.

## Academic Honesty

Keep in mind that assignment solutions provided in this repository *should not* be used as a source of information by anyone currently taking CS50x, as per Academic Honesty rules:

> The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on assessments (e.g., assignments, labs, problem sets, projects, quizzes, or tests) is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your work to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policyâ€™s other constraints.

For more information, see [CS50x: Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/honesty/).
